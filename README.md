## Overview of the App

We implemented Unstoppable Domains Login Option.

The application interacts with JS HTTP Client through a public Ceramic node. In addition we create a deterministic Ceramic Tile and resolve an unstoppable domain which we store in the decentralized profile of the user.

Ceramic allows users to have complete ownership over their data by providing decentralized technologies for authentication and data storage.
